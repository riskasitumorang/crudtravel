    That's why, when you travel to various places within a considerable distance, you can be called traveling. 
    This word is actually not much different in meaning with the word "trip".Tourism is a travel activity carried out by a person or group of people by visiting certain places for the purpose of recreation, personal development, or studying the uniqueness of the tourist attractions visited in a temporary period.

        itself, but also seen from the facilities, services, services, marketing, and
